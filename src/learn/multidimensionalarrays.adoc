== Arrays Can Have Multiple Dimensions

// This is a single-dimensional array of ints of size 4
int[] samples = new int[4];

// This is a two-dimensional array of of chars of
// size 4 in the first dimension and 8 in the second
char[][] board = new char[4][8];

// This is a three-dimensional array of of doubles of
// size 6 in the first dimension, 8 in the second,
// and 10 in the third

== Multi-Dimensional Array Initialization

[.lead]
//
We can also initialize multi-dimensional arrays:

[source,java]
----
int[][] measurements = {
  { 1, 2 }
  { 3, 4 }
}
// This is equivalent to
int measurements = new int[2][2];
measurements[0][0] = 1;
measurements[0][1] = 2;
measurements[1][0] = 3;
measurements[1][1] = 4;

== You're In Charge

[.lead]
//
The first, second, third, or Nth index of an array mean _whatever you want_.

This is particularly important when representing certain kinds of data using
multi-dimensional arrays.

//
What kind of data would work well in a multi-dimensional array?

[.s]
//
* *Pictures and images:* each pixel is stored in a 2-dimensional grid
//
* *Higher-dimensional data:* our world is 3D&mdash;4D, actually&mdash;so our
data should be as well.
//
* *Sound:* even data that might _seem_ one dimensional often turns out to be
more complicated than we expected

== Announcements

* link:/MP/1/[MP1] is out and due _on Friday_. Please get started! Today is the
best day to come to office hours.

* link:info/resources/#emp[EMP (Even More Practice)] continues _tonight_ from
5&ndash;7PM in *Siebel 1404*.
//
This is where it will be held for the rest of the semester.
//
*If you struggled on MP0, Quiz 1, or TC 1 or TC2, be there.*

* The next set of Turing's Craft exercises (TC3) are due _tomorrow_ at midnight.
