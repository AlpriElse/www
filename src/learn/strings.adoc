== Consecutive Identical Values

[.lead]
//
Given a string, find all cases where consecutive characters are the same.

*First, what is our algorithm?*

[.s]
//
. Examine each character in the array
//
. Compare it with the next character&mdash;but how do we get at that?
//
. Print it out if they are the same
