<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a source code version control system (VCS), also
known as <em>version control</em>.
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is as website providing Git repository hosting and
an attractive and powerful Git web interface.
Version control systems are at the heart of how programmers manage and share
source code.
Both Git and GitHub are extremely commonly used in the world of software
development, and you will benefit greatly from familiarity with them.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="vcs">1. Why Use Source Version Control?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A source code repository is a bit like the shared folders that are provided by
services like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://www.box.com">Box</a>, and
<a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>.
You can save files and folders and share them with other users in various
ways.
Some of these tools even track allow you to undo and redo changes and see how
files have changed over time.
These are useful tools, and a great way to collaborate with others in a
variety of different scenarios.
So it&#8217;s normal to wonder: what&#8217;s different about source version control?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compared to tools like Dropbox, source version control provides programmers
with several important advantages.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_versioning_entire_projects">1.1. Versioning Entire Projects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, version control systems track the version of <em>all the files in each
repository</em>, rather than individual files separately.
Programming frequently involves making a set of changes to a group of files that
together accomplish something&mdash;like fixing a bug or adding a new feature.
So when you commit your work using Git, it remembers the state of all the files
in your repository at that time.
This allows you to compare what your project looked like at different times, and
undo an entire set of changes that might have caused a problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this also means that Git <strong>does not</strong> track all the changes you save
to a file.
Unless you commit your changes, they are not saved to your repository.
This may seem like an annoyance&mdash;after all, systems like Dropbox will sync
your files every time you save them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when programming this turns out to be a <em>huge</em> advantage.
Let&#8217;s say you save a version of <code>Foo.java</code> to test&mdash;but it contains errors.
Now if you are using Dropbox, everyone has that broken version of the file.
But if you are using Git, you can test your code, notice the errors, and fix
them before committing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Git commit is really their equivalent of the save operation.
Regardless of whether you save your files in IntelliJ or any other way, you have
to add commit them to your repository before it will save and remember them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_version_comments">1.2. Version Comments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version control systems also allow you to add your own notes to each commit.
This is called a <em>comment</em>.
Comments should summarize what changes are included in the new version of the
project.
Good comments are extremely helpful to other developers that are trying to
understand how the code is evolving.
All version control systems have ways to view the list of version with their
comments.
This can be useful when you want to see how things have changed, or back up
and use an older version of a project where some feature was working that
isn&#8217;t any more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_merging_changes">1.3. Merging Changes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, version control systems help you merge changes made by different
developers&mdash;even to the same file.
Say that <code>Foo.java</code> has 1000 lines.
Alice makes a change at the top of the file.
Concurrently, Bob makes a change to the bottom of the file.
Systems like Dropbox will typically force you to address this conflict by
choosing either Alice&#8217;s version of the file or Bob&#8217;s.
But version control systems can frequently <em>automatically</em> merge
non-overlapping changes to source code files&mdash;allowing you to choose to
combine the changes from Alice with the changes from Bob.
When you are working in large teams on large software projects, this
capability is extremely handy.</p>

<h2 id="git">2. Introduction to Git and GitHub</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Now let&#8217;s go through the basics of how to use Git.
But please don&#8217;t consider this guide exhaustive&mdash;there are much more useful
and up-to-date guides all over the internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_basic_principles">2.1. Basic Principles</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git organizes your files into a <em>repository</em>.
A repository can contain any number of files organized any way you like.
A single repository usually contains all of the code used by a single project.
For CS 125, you will use a single repository for each MP <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git stores a copy of your repository on your local machine.
But to submit and to backup your work, you are going to <em>push</em> your changes to
the GitHub Git hosting service.
So first we have to create a GitHub account and configure IntelliJ to use it.</p>
</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before you can use Git with IntelliJ, you need to install the underlying Git
tool itself.
Head to the
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git downloads page</a>
and follow the appropriate instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that you do <em>not</em> need to install a GUI for Git&mdash;or the
<a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>
application.
We&#8217;re going to use IntelliJ&#8217;s excellent built-in Git interface.
So once you&#8217;ve
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">installed Git</a>
you can move on.</p>

<h3 id="account">2.3. Joining GitHub</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Joining GitHub is simple!
If you don&#8217;t already have an account, head to
<a href="https://github.com/join">this page</a>
to sign up.
It&#8217;s quick, free, and painless.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you already have an account, just keep using it for your CS 125 assignments.
Note that there is also no requirement that you identify yourself as a CS 125 or
even as an Illinois student with GitHub to submit your CS 125 assignments.
We&#8217;ll discuss how to identify yourself your submissions
<a href="#identify">later</a>.
However, if you add your @illinois.edu email to your profile as your primary
email address, it will improve integration with our official grading system.</p>

<h2 id="workflow">3. CS 125 Git Workflow</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost all of your interaction with Git this semester will be through two
powerful interfaces: the
<a href="/MP/setup/intellij">IntelliJ IDE</a>,
and
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
Let&#8217;s walk through a typical MP workflow to get a sense for how you will
normally be using Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="cloning">3.1. Cloning the MP Starter Code Using GitHub</h3>
<div class="row justify-content-center mt-3 mb-3">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
      <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/A6DGPMlHnH4" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin each MP <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> you will use a special link to
<em>clone</em> a Git repository on
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
That repository contains starter code that we provide for each assignment,
including completed portions of the assignment and testing suites.
Cloning a Git repository on GitHub makes a copy of it that you now have
permission to modify.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is straightforward to start a new IntelliJ project Using an existing GitHub
repository&#8212;&#8203;either one you created or one that was created for you when you
accepted our MP invitation link.
Simply choose the "Check out from Version Control" option in the main IntelliJ
menu and then select "GitHub".
If you have not yet added your GitHub credentials to IntelliJ, it will ask you
to do that, and then for the URL of the GitHub repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="importing">3.2. Importing Your New Project Into IntelliJ</h3>
<div class="row justify-content-center mt-3 mb-3">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will then use IntelliJ to import the new project from your remote GitHub
Repository.
IntelliJ makes this extremely easy: there is an option to create a new project
from a remote repository.
This step will download the code from GitHub to your local machine and allow you
to begin making and testing your changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="identifying">3.3. Identifying Yourself</h3>
<div class="row justify-content-center mt-3 mb-3">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before you can run the local autograder or receive credit for a submission, you
must identify yourself.
This links your @illinois.edu identify to your repository so that you can
receive credit for your work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the root directory of each project you will submit, there is a file called
<code>email.txt</code>.
Enter your @illinois.edu email address into that file on a single line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note that it is critical that you do this properly.</strong>
If you enter an incorrect email address, you will not receive credit for your
work.
If you enter the email address of another student, we will investigate your
submission for plagiarism and potentially file a
<a href="https://history.illinois.edu/resources/faculty-resources/reporting-academic-integrity-infractions">FAIR
report</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="autograding">3.4. Running the Autograder</h3>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you complete each assignment, you&#8217;ll want to track your progress and get a
sense of how you are doing.
To aid with that process, we&#8217;ve provided an autograder that you can run as
many times as you like.
Each time, it <em>estimates</em> the score that you&#8217;d earn on the assignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Please note that the autograder only provides an estimate of your score.</strong>
While we have tried as hard as possible to make the autograder run similarly on
your machine and in official grading, it is impossible to ensure identical
behavior.
So use the autograder to estimate your score as you go&mdash;but be sure to
submit and view your official score before the assignment deadline.</p>

<h3 id="committing">3.5. Committing (Saving) Your Work</h3>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version control systems only save the change you have made when you
tell them to.
This is called a <em>commit</em>, and the process called <em>committing</em>.
Given that committing is essentially saving your changes, this have given rise
to memes like the one on the right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you commit a version of a file, Git will remember its committed
contents forever&mdash;even if you change or delete it the file.
So you should get into the habit of committing early and often.
Here are some good times to commit your code:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You just started a project&mdash;make sure to record it in its initial
state!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You just finished writing a function&mdash;that way you can always get back
to that version if you make changes later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You just passed one test case&mdash;make sure that Git remembers what
worked forever!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are about to take a break or go to bed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MP deadline is in thirty minutes&mdash;or in five minutes!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Get in the habit now of committing your code regularly.</strong>
Version control systems are very efficient at storing commits, and so the
overhead of performing them is small.
Better to have things saved than to want desperately to get back to a previous
version or remember how you did something and not have it committed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that most version control systems will require you to tell them the first
time you want to add a new file to a project.
Once you do this once, that file will be tracked in the future&mdash;but there
is an initial step that you may sometimes miss.
However, IntelliJ is good about reminding you about this, as long as you don&#8217;t
disable those reminders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IntelliJ has a convenient interface for committing changes, adding commit messages,
pushing to GitHub, and generally tracking the state of your repository.</p>
