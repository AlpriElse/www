<p>We think that you&#8217;ll have the best success in CS 125 working on your own
personal computer&mdash;preferably a laptop.
However, if you need to use the engineering workstations in the basement of
Siebel and other engineering buildings, instructions follow.</p>

<h2 id="_git_and_java">1. Git and Java</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Happily both Git and Java are already installed on the EWS machines.
At present Java is still on version 1.8, and it is the
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">open source OpenJDK</a>
rather than the proprietary Oracle JDK.
We don&#8217;t think that this is going to matter, but if you are worried that it
might you can install Oracle Java by following the
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html">instructions
on their web site</a>.</p>

<p>IntelliJ is available using the
<a href="https://it.engineering.illinois.edu/user-guides/software/linux-software-modules">EWS
Linux software modules system</a>.
The screencast above walks you through the process of activating and using the
module.
At that point you can continue with the instructions about
<a href="/MP/setup/intellij#checkstyle">installing the <code>checkstyle</code> IntelliJ plugin</a>
and establishing your
