<p>Functions are an important part of how we structure computer programs.
Breaking your code into well-documented functions makes it easier to understand,
easier to test and debug, and easier for others to use.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>MP2 comprises four small functions that exercise your growing programming
abilities in several different ways.
You&#8217;ll get practice working with strings and arrays, and a gentle introduction
to two-dimensional arrays.</p>

<p><strong>MP2 is due Friday 2/9/2018 @ 5PM.
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.</strong>
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP2 is for submitting code that earns at least
<em>20 points</em> by <strong>Wednesday 2/7/2018 @ 7PM.</strong>
Note that, unlike <a href="/MP/1">MP1</a>, you have to do a bit more work on MP2 to get
to 20 points.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">1. Learning Objectives</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MP2 aims to provide practice with defining, documenting, and implementing
functions&mdash;the basic building blocks of computer programs.
You&#8217;ll begin to learn how to:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>declare and implement functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>write Javadoc comments for your new functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>read Javadoc documentation to determine how to implement a function</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use simple two-dimensional arrays</p>
</li>

<h2 id="structure">2. Assignment Structure</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MP2 consists of four short programs:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP2-Starter/Anagram.html"><code>Anagram.java</code></a>:
determines if two strings are anagrams.
You will need to complete this function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP2-Starter/CheckPassword.html"><code>CheckPassword.java</code></a>:
checks if a password meets certain requirements.
You will need to declare and complete this function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP2-Starter/StringSplitter.html"><code>StringSplitter.java</code></a>:
splits a string whenever the character changes.
You will need to declare, complete, and document this function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP2-Starter/TimesTable.html"><code>TimesTable.java</code></a>:
produces a times table given two numbers.
<strong>This file doesn&#8217;t even exist yet!</strong>
You&#8217;ll have to create it, and then declare, complete, and document
<code>createTimesTable</code>.
You&#8217;ll also need to add a <code>main</code> method if you want to test it without using
test suite.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will need to use our official
<a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP2-Starter/">MP2 online documentation</a>
to understand what the functions are called and what they are supposed to do,
since we have not always provided documentation&mdash;or even a file to start
with at all!</p>

<h3 id="requirements">2.2. Your Goal</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point you should be familiar with the requirements from
<a href="/MP/0#requirements">MP0</a> and <a href="/MP/1#requirements">MP1</a>.
MP2 is similar.
However, unlike <a href="/MP/0">MP0</a> and <a href="/MP/1">MP1</a> you no longer get free
points for your code compiling.
In the real world it doesn&#8217;t matter if your code compiles&mdash;it has to work!</p>

<h2 id="approach">3. Fixing Problems</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of the <a href="/MP/0#approach">MP0</a> and <a href="/MP/1#approach">MP1</a> about how to
approach the MPs still apply.
But as usual, we&#8217;ll furnish your continued development as programmers with some
additional advice&mdash;this time about <em>fixing problems</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve all been there.
My stupid code is not working!
Why not?
I&#8217;m angry, I&#8217;m frustrated, I want to throw my computer through a window or stomp
it to bits.
<strong>What should you do?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_calm_down">3.1. Calm Down</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, the first thing to do is <em>calm down</em>.
This can be a good time to get a cup of coffee, take a walk, engage in some
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dsGWM5XGdg">YouTube browsing</a>,
catch up on email, or whatever
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>
Get your head out of what you are doing for a few minutes and you&#8217;ll be fresher
when you get back.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_accept_responsibility">3.2. Accept Responsibility</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, accept that something is <em>wrong with your code</em>.
If it&#8217;s not doing what you want, then that&#8217;s obvious.
And for CS 125, the test suites are the arbiters of correctness.
So if you aren&#8217;t passing them, then your code is incorrect.
Period.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_do_a_slow_close_read">3.3. Do A Slow, Close Read</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you&#8217;re calmer and ready to find your mistakes, go through your code
carefully line by line.
This can be a good time to do some cleanup&mdash;add comments where needed,
improve your variable names, get all of your indentation and formatting worked
out, etc.
Sometimes looking at your code in a slightly different way causes a bug to
become apparent.
And you might as well be doing other useful tasks as you do your close read.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During your first slow read it can be helpful to actually read code out loud, or
at least in your head so that you don&#8217;t bother others around you.
For example, if you&#8217;re examining the code below:</p>
</div>
<script
src="https://gist.github.com/gchallen/b6ff23b1c26659f920e8a71026816c42.js"></script>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might say:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic spelling_exception">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>"For every index value of searchArray" (you want to develop a shorthand for
loops)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"If the index member of anotherArray is equal to what I&#8217;m search for"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Then break."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"But wait, why am I using an index from searchArray to look in anotherArray?
That&#8217;s probably wrong."</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a place where it <em>really</em> helps to use variable names that aren&#8217;t <code>i</code>
and <code>j</code>, and to pull the current value of arrays into a local variable
immediately or use the
<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/corejavatechtips/using-enhanced-for-loops-with-your-classes">new
enhanced <code>for</code> loop syntax</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_add_instrumentation">3.4. Add Instrumentation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you&#8217;ve completed one pass, start over and begin adding some
<code>System.out.println</code> statements.
This is sometimes called <code>printf</code> <em>debugging</em>, after the
<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_printf.htm">C
language <code>printf</code> statement</a>&mdash;its
equivalent to <code>System.out.println</code> in Java.
In Java, of course, you would use <code>System.out.println</code> to do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will find that there are snobs out there that look down on <code>printf</code>
debugging.
Hook up a real debugger, they&#8217;ll say.
Or rewrite your entire project using a functional programming language where
bugs are impossible&mdash;as if that&#8217;s a real possibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then there are the rest of use that just want to build cool and useful
things as quickly as possible, and who will <em>happily</em> take the chance to add
instrumentation as needed.
<code>printf</code> debugging is not powerful enough to solve every problem, and there are
times that you will need better tools.
But use it when you can.
And remind the snobs what none other than
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a> says:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with
judiciously placed print statements.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/238686">Brian Kernighan</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually the right approach is to start at the top of the block of code that you
are examining and use <code>System.out.println</code> to examine things that you are unsure
are working properly.
This is particularly useful when used in conjunction with test suites.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_consider_a_different_approach">3.5. Consider A Different Approach</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are really stuck, it might be time to try a different approach.
This is particularly true when you can acknowledge that your current approach
has some, shall we say, limitations.
Maybe you thought that this particular way of doing things would work out well,
but then you had to add one hacky bit, and another.
And now it&#8217;s rapidly approaching spaghetti code that you&#8217;re not even sure that
you understand anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In that case, by all means start over!
You&#8217;re learning, and you&#8217;ll learn more by completing a few alternative
implementations than you will by clinging to an ugly solution.
Feel free to talk to another student&mdash;<a href="#cheating"><em>In
English</em></a>&mdash;about how they approached the problem.
Maybe they found a much cleaner way that you can try.</p>

<p>Note that, unlike <a href="/MP/1/">MP1</a>, you do need to do a bit of work to get to 20
points, since there are no free points for just getting things to compile.

compile, which requires at least defining the functions and in case of
