<p>In this lab we&#8217;ll do a small programming project start to finish.
Our task today brings together many of the concepts that we&#8217;ve discussed in
class this semester&mdash;data representation, loops, arrays, and algorithms.</p>

<p>We begin with a short warmup designed to familiarize you with the key concepts
that we&#8217;ll be using in the coding portion of the lab.</p>

<p>Complete this part of the lab in pairs using Google Docs.
Create a copy of <a href="https://goo.gl/L2op7F">our document template</a>, and then edit it
to record you and your partner&#8217;s answers.

We will not grant access to non-Illinois users.</p>

<p>Computer scientists are a resourceful and creative bunch <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.

better&mdash;which tend to be repetitive and dull anyway.</p>

<p>Why should I sit there with a pen and paper listening to Morse code and trying
to decode it?
I can teach a computer to do that, and then it&#8217;ll do it all day, all night,
without errors, until the end of time.
That sounds like a lot more fun than doing it myself&mdash;so let&#8217;s give it a
shot.
It turns out to be not so hard.</p>

<h3 id="_forking_and_cloning_the_lab7_intellij_project">2.1. Forking and Cloning the Lab7 IntelliJ Project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve set up an
<a href="https://github.com/cs125-illinois/Lab7">Lab 7 GitHub repository</a>
containing an IntelliJ Project that&#8217;s correctly configured for Lab 7.
Getting access to it is similar to how you
<a href="/MP/setup/git/#importing">imported MP0</a>.
But you have to fork our repository first.
If it&#8217;s not obvious how to do that, try following
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">these instructions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="approach">2.2. Our Approach</h3>
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>This may seem like a daunting task at first, but let&#8217;s break it down into its
component parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We know that Morse code consists of <em>tones</em> of different <em>lengths</em> separated by
<em>silence</em>.
That naturally leads to several questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>How do we distinguish between tones and silence?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once we can do that, how do we distinguish between long tones (dashes) and
short tones (dots). We also need to be able to detect long periods of silence
which are used to separate characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once we can do that, how do we translate things from Morse code to
alphanumeric characters?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve provided some starter code to get you going, and in particular to help you
pull audio samples out of the WAV file.
Use that as a starting point, and work on each of the subproblems above.
You&#8217;ll probably find it helpful to draw pictures and compare code with other
partner groups&mdash;this is completely legal for this lab.
At intervals the course staff will pause and go over a solution to each of the
steps outlined above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will want to understand the <code>WavFile</code> library that we provide.
<a href="http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/audio/javaWavFiles.html">Here is some documentation
by the original author</a>,
and we also have
<a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/wavfile/">our own package documentation
available online</a>.
You may also want to review the
<a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Lab7/MorseDecoder.html">Lab 7 documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most importantly, have fun!
When you are done you should be able to decode <code>1.wav</code> and <code>2.wav</code>.
Then take a stab at <code>HW0.wav</code>, which you decoded previously as part of our early
homework assignment.
That file is a bit different than the others, and you may find that you need to
fiddle with your parameters a bit to get it to work.</p>

<p>Use any remaining time in your lab section to get help with <a href="/MP/4/">MP4</a>.
If you are finished or far along, please help others&mdash;but help them
<em>learn</em>, don&#8217;t just give them the answers.
And if you are behind, please reach out the course staff for help.</p>
