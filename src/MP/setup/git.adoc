//
https://git-scm.com/[Git] is a source code version control system (VCS), also
known as _version control_.
//
https://github.com/[GitHub] is as website providing Git repository hosting and
an attractive and powerful Git web interface.
//
Version control systems are at the heart of how programmers manage and share
source code.
//
Both Git and GitHub are extremely commonly used in the world of software
development, and you will benefit greatly from familiarity with them.

== Why Use Source Version Control?

A source code repository is a bit like the shared folders that are provided by
services like https://www.dropbox.com[Dropbox], https://www.box.com[Box], and
https://drive.google.com[Google Drive].
//
You can save files and folders and share them with other users in various
ways.
//
Some of these tools even track allow you to undo and redo changes and see how
files have changed over time.
//
These are useful tools, and a great way to collaborate with others in a
variety of different scenarios.
//
So it's normal to wonder: what's different about source version control?

Compared to tools like Dropbox, source version control provides programmers
with several important advantages.

=== Versioning Entire Projects

First, version control systems track the version of _all the files in each
repository_, rather than individual files separately.
//
Programming frequently involves making a set of changes to a group of files that
together accomplish something&mdash;like fixing a bug or adding a new feature.
//
So when you commit your work using Git, it remembers the state of all the files
in your repository at that time.
//
This allows you to compare what your project looked like at different times, and
undo an entire set of changes that might have caused a problem.

Note that this also means that Git **does not** track all the changes you save
to a file.
//
Unless you commit your changes, they are not saved to your repository.
//
This may seem like an annoyance&mdash;after all, systems like Dropbox will sync
your files every time you save them.

But when programming this turns out to be a _huge_ advantage.
//
Let's say you save a version of `Foo.java` to test&mdash;but it contains errors.
//
Now if you are using Dropbox, everyone has that broken version of the file.
//
But if you are using Git, you can test your code, notice the errors, and fix
them before committing.

A Git commit is really their equivalent of the save operation.
//
Regardless of whether you save your files in IntelliJ or any other way, you have
to add commit them to your repository before it will save and remember them.

=== Version Comments

Version control systems also allow you to add your own notes to each commit.
//
This is called a _comment_.
//
Comments should summarize what changes are included in the new version of the
project.
//
Good comments are extremely helpful to other developers that are trying to
understand how the code is evolving.
//
All version control systems have ways to view the list of version with their
comments.
//
This can be useful when you want to see how things have changed, or back up
and use an older version of a project where some feature was working that
isn't any more.

=== Merging Changes

Second, version control systems help you merge changes made by different
developers&mdash;even to the same file.
//
Say that `Foo.java` has 1000 lines.
//
Alice makes a change at the top of the file.
//
Concurrently, Bob makes a change to the bottom of the file.
//
Systems like Dropbox will typically force you to address this conflict by
choosing either Alice's version of the file or Bob's.
//
But version control systems can frequently _automatically_ merge
non-overlapping changes to source code files&mdash;allowing you to choose to
combine the changes from Alice with the changes from Bob.
//
When you are working in large teams on large software projects, this
capability is extremely handy.

[[workflow]]
== CS 125 Git Workflow

Almost all of your interaction with Git this semester will be through two
powerful interfaces: the
//
link:/MP/setup/intellij[IntelliJ IDE],
//
and
//
https://github.com/[GitHub].
//
Let's walk through a typical MP workflow to get a sense for how you will
normally be using Git.

=== Cloning the MP Starter Code Using GitHub

To begin each MP footnote:[and during many labs], you will use a special link to
_clone_ a Git repository on
//
https://github.com/[GitHub].
//
That repository contains starter code that we provide for each assignment,
including completed portions of the assignment and testing suites.
//
Cloning a Git repository on GitHub makes a copy of it that you now have
permission to modify.

=== Creating a New Project Using IntelliJ

You will then use IntelliJ to initialize a new project from your remote GitHub
Repository.
//
IntelliJ makes this extremely easy: there is an option to create a new project
from a remote repository.
//
This step will download the code from GitHub to your local machine and allow you
to begin making and testing your changes.

=== Committing and Pushing Changes Using IntelliJ

As you work on the assignment, you will want to regularly _commit_ your work.
//
Each time you commit, you record the state of your repository locally.
//
You can also choose to _push_ your changes to GitHub.
//
Once they are saved to GitHub, they will persist even if your hard drive dies,
or if you accidentally delete your entire local repository.
//
IntelliJ has a convenient interface for committing changes, adding commit messages,
pushing to GitHub, and generally tracking the state of your repository.

=== Submitting Your Work Using IntelliJ

For CS 125 you submit your work by _pushing_ it to GitHub.
//
We will grade each version of your MP that you push and provide you with the
best score modulo penalties and other score calculations.

[[git]]
== Introduction to Git

[.lead]
//
Now let's go through the basics of how to use Git.
//
But please don't consider this guide exhaustive&mdash;there are much more useful
and up-to-date guides all over the internet.

Git organizes your files into a _repository_.
//
A repository can contain any number of files organized any way you like.
//
A single repository usually contains all of the code used by a single project.
//
For CS 125, you will use a single repository for each MP footnote:[and for some
labs].

Git stores a copy of your repository on your local machine.
//
But to submit and to backup your work, you are going to _push_ your changes to
the GitHub Git hosting service.
//
So first we have to create a GitHub account and configure IntelliJ to use it.

[[account]]
=== Creating a GitHub Account

Joining GitHub is simple!
//
If you don't already have an account, head to
//
https://github.com/join[this page]
//
to sign up.
//
It's quick, free, and painless.

If you already have an account, just keep using it for your CS 125 assignments.
//
Note that there is also no requirement that you identify yourself as a CS 125 or
even as an Illinois student with GitHub to submit your CS 125 assignments.
//
We'll discuss how to identify yourself your submissions later TODO.

[[connecting]]
=== Creating a New IntelliJ Project Using a GitHub Repository

It is straightforward to start a new IntelliJ project Using an existing GitHub
repository--either one you created or one that was created for you when you
accepted our MP invitation link.
//
Simply choose the "Check out from Version Control" option in the main IntelliJ
menu and then select "GitHub".
//
If you have not yet added your GitHub credentials to IntelliJ, it will ask you
to do that, and then for the URL of the GitHub repository.

[[commit]]
=== Committing Changes to Your Local Repository

Remember: version control systems only save the change you have made when you
tell them to.
//
This is called a _commit_, and the process called _committing_.
//
Given that committing is essentially saving your changes, this have given rise
to memes like the one on the right.

Once you commit a version of a file, Git will remember its committed
contents forever&mdash;even if you change or delete it the file.
//
So you should get into the habit of committing early and often.
//
Here are some good times to commit your code:

* You just started a project&mdash;make sure to record it in its initial
state!
//
* You just finished writing a function&mdash;that way you can always get back
to that version if you make changes later.
//
* You just passed one test case&mdash;make sure that Git remembers what
worked forever!
//
* You are about to take a break or go to bed.
//
* The MP deadline is in thirty minutes&mdash;or in five minutes!

**Get in the habit now of committing your code regularly.**
//
Version control systems are very efficient at storing commits, and so the
overhead of performing them is small.
//
Better to have things saved than to want desperately to get back to a previous
version or remember how you did something and not have it committed.

Note that most version control systems will require you to tell them the first
time you want to add a new file to a project.
//
Once you do this once, that file will be tracked in the future&mdash;but there
is an initial step that you may sometimes miss.
//
However, IntelliJ is good about reminding you about this, as long as you don't
disable those reminders.

[[push]]
=== Pushing Changes to Your GitHub Repository

[[update]]
=== Retrieving Changes to Your GitHub Repository

Committing allows you to save your changes to the project in your repository.
//
To retrieve updates made by others, you perform an _pull_.

Git, like other version control systems, provides you with control over when you
receive updates.
//
This is another big advantage when compared with systems like Dropbox that
propagate changes immediately.
//
If you are working with others, you may not want to see their changes
immediately&mdash;particularly if they might interfere with what you are working
on.
//
Having to update manually means that you get to choose a moment when you are
ready to receive changes.

In CS 125 you are working on assignments independently&mdash;so you might ask,
who else would be updating my repository?
//
Normally, nobody.
//
But it's possible that you may choose to work on two different machines&mdash;a
laptop and a desktop at home.
//
Assuming you have set up IntelliJ and Git properly on both, you can use the
update command on one machine to retrieve commits made on the other.

Here's how you perform an update in Eclipse:

. Right click on the project that you want to update.
//
. Click "Team &rarr; Update HEAD". This will get you the latest changes.

At this point it is possible that the changes made by others have conflicted
with yours.
//
If this happens, Eclipse will mark the files in your project for you to fix.

[[comparing]]
=== Comparing Your Local and GitHub Repositories

Version control systems are designed to allow you to compare between your local
files and the copies that are available in the repository.
//
So you should never browse the contents of your remote repository to make sure
that it's contents are up-to-date.
//
Not only is that tedious, but it doesn't work well once your repository has even
just a few files.

Instead, use Git to examine the differences between your local files and
your remote repository.
//
Here's how:

== How to Learn More

As usual the internet is the best way to find out more about anything related
to technology.
//
There are great Git tutorials out there that you can find on Google.
