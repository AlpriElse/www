== What Are Computers Good At?

. Basic math
//
. Simple decision making
//
. Doing things over and over again very, very fast

== !Basic Math

[role='janini']
....
// Computers can do basic math
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
System.out.println(x + y);
int z = x + y + 1;
System.out.println(z);
....

== !Simple Decision Making

[role='janini']
....
// Computers can make simple decisions
int temperature =
if (temperature < 32 && temperature >= 0) {
  System.out.print("It's cold");
} else if (temperature < 0) {
  System.out.println("It's really cold");
}
....

== !Computers Can Repeat Over And Over Quickly

[role='janini']
....
// Computers can perform many, many calculations extremely quickly.
long i = 0;
while (i < 10000000L) {
  i++;
}
System.out.println("Finished");
....

*All things you _aren't_ good at!*

== Your Perfect Complement

[.lead]
//
*Together you can solve any problem.*

== Concept and Craft

[.lead]
//
Computer science is both a _conceptual_ and an _applied_ discipline.

[.s]
//
* *Concepts*: computer science has deep roots in mathematics and explores the
fundamental heart of problem solving
//
* *Craft*: as you learn computer science, you learn the most powerful skill on
Earth: programming.

== Concepts

[.s]
//
* *Algorithms*: ways of solving problems and what makes certain problems hard
//
* *Representation*: representing data so that computers can manipulate it
//
* *Recursion*: breaking down problems into smaller, manageable pieces

== Craft

[.s]
//
* *Imperative programming*: solving problems using constructs like
loops and conditional expressions
//
* *Object-oriented programming*: design patterns for starting to work on larger
software projects
//
* *Software development*: design, style, debugging, testing, and other core
software development competencies

== Lectures

Lectures are taught in an active learning style.
//
We'll spend our time reading and writing code together, just like the examples
we started class with.

== MPs

[.lead]
//
Programming is about practice. Period.

The programming assignments&mdash;known at CS@Illinois as _machine
problems_&mdash;are an enormous part of how you learn the material.
//
Start them early, get help as needed, and don't give up! The more you work at
them, the more you learn.

== !Up And To The Right

== Beginner's Rule

[.s]
* Many of you are beginners, but not all of you.
//
* If you're new and you meet someone that seems much better than you&mdash;they
have probably just had more practice.

* Don't get discouraged!
//
*But the only way to catch up is to keep practicing.*
//
* You _will_ get better. And it gets fun _fast_...

== How To Succeed in CS 125

[.s]
//
. Prepare for, attend, and participate in your assigned lecture and lab section
//
. Start the MPs early and make a regular appointment to come to office hours
//
. Don't miss the weekly quizzes in the CBTF&mdash;they start this week
