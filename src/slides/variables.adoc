== What Are Computers Good At?

. Basic math
//
. Simple decision making
//
. Doing things over and over again very, very fast

== !Basic Math

[role='janini']
....
// Computers can do basic math
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
System.out.println(x + y);
int z = x + y + 1;
System.out.println(z);
....

== !Simple Decision Making

[role='janini']
....
// Computers can make simple decisions
int temperature =
if (temperature < 32 && temperature >= 0) {
  System.out.print("It's cold");
} else if (temperature < 0) {
  System.out.println("It's really cold");
}
....

== !Computers Can Repeat Over And Over Quickly

[role='janini']
....
// Computers can make many small calculations quickly.
long i = 0;
while (i < 10000000L) {
  i++;
}
System.out.println("Finished");
