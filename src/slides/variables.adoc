== You're Learning a New Language

And your computer is a very eager but unforgiving conversant

== Our Approach

[.s]
//
* Start small: with just a few lines of code
//
* Work up to slightly more complicated examples
//
* Then to complete functions and algorithms
//
* And eventually to understanding entire files of Java source code

== What Are Computers Good At?

. *Basic math*
//
. Simple decision making
//
. Doing things over and over again very, very fast
//
. *And storing data*

== Variable Declaration

[source,java]
----
// I declare a variable named c of type char
char c;

// I'm going to use an int and call it first
int first;

// I hereby create a boolean and shall name it isSet
boolean isSet;
----

[.s]
//
* In Java every variable has a _name_ and a _type_
//
* The name is for you, the programmer
//
* The type is both for you and for Java

== Variable Names Must Be Unique

[source,java]
----
// I declare a variable named c of type char
char c;

// This doesn't work. How will I tell them apart?
int c;

// Even this doesn't work if c has already been declared.
char c;
----

* There are rules allowing the same name to be used in multiple places in the
same program
//
* We'll learn about them later

== Good Variable Names

[.lead]
//
Choosing good variable names will make your life a lot easier as a programmer.

Good variable names are:

[.s]
//
. Descriptive
//
. Indicative of the variable's function
//
. As succinct as possible...
//
. But see #2 above
//
. This will make more sense as we go along

== Comments

[source,java]
----
// Also: this is a single-line comment.
// It starts with a //

/*
 * Here is another one. Multiline comments start with /* and end with
 */

// Comments are ignored by the computer, but can be
// some of the most important parts of your code
// They're for you and other humans
----

== Variable Types

[.lead]
//
Java has _eight_
//
http://cs.fit.edu/~ryan/java/language/java-data.html[primitive data types].

All other data in Java is represented by _combinations_ of these building blocks.
//
You can break them into four categories:

[.s]
//
. *Integers*: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
//
. *Floating point numbers*: `float`, `double`
//
. *Character*: `char`
//
. *True or false*: `boolean`

== Variable Initialization

[source,java]
----
// I declare a variable named mine of type float
// and initialize it to 0.1
float mine = 0.1;

// Let there be a boolean called isItSnowing
// and initialize it to false
boolean isItSnowing = false;

// Declare timeSince1979 of type long
// and initially set it to 1204209
long timeSince1979 = 1204209;
----

== Experimenting With Initialization

[role='janini']
....
// Let's create and initialize some variables of different types
float x;
System.out.println(x);
// Try reinitializing the same variable to see what happens
....

== Literals

A _literal_ is a number or other value that appears directly in the source
code.

[source,java]
----
// 1000 is a long literal. Note the L suffix.
long big = 1000L;

// 'g' is a character literal.
char one = 'g';

// true and false are boolean literals.
boolean itsEarly = true;
boolean iSleptWell = false;
----

== Variables Can Be Modified

[role='janini']
....
// Let's modify some integers
int changing = 10;
changing = 20; // I can set them again
changing = 20 + 10; // Math is OK on the right side
changing += 1; // I have some special operators
changing /= 2; // +, -, / and * all work with =
....

== Variables Must Maintain the Same Type

[role='janini']
....
// Ruh-roh...
int changing = 10;
changing = 10.0;
....

== !Ruh-Roh

== Variables Can Be Modified Using Other Variables

[role='janini']
....
double first = 10.0;
double second = 5.0;
first = second; // This is assignment, not equality
second = 20.0;
first = second + 10.0;
double third = 2.0;
first = second + third;
....

== What Makes Primitive Types _Primitive_?

[.s.lead]
//
.What makes the Java primitive types primitive?
//
* They can all be stored by the computer as a _single number_.

[.s.lead]
--
But wait... what about `char`?
--

== !What About Characters?

== Our First Example of a _Convention_

[.lead]
//
There's no law of the universe that says that the number 97 should represent
'a'.

It's just what we've all agreed on.

We'll discuss floating point representation in lab next week&mdash;it's pretty
cool.

== Why Are There Multiple Numeric Types?

[.lead]
//
. *Integers*: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
//
. *Floating point numbers*: `float`, `double`

[.s]
--
Different types take up different amounts of _computer memory_ and so can store
different values.
--

[.s]
--
*Don't worry too much about how things are stored yet.* But the limits are
important to understand.
--

== Type Limitations

[role='janini']
....
byte smallest = 10;
smallest += 256;
System.out.println(smallest);
....

== Why Types

[.s.lead]
//
* Types force you to specify how much space you need to store your data. That
can make your program more efficient
//
* Types also help catch some common programming errors

[.oneword]
== Questions About Variables?

== Comparisons

[.lead]
//
Java also allows me to compare different variables: either against literal
values, or against other variables.

This is basis for _simple decision making_.

== Simple Comparisons

[role='janini']
....
// Let's try out ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=
int tester = 10;
// This is equality
System.out.println(tester == 10);
....

== A Common Mistake

[.lead]
//
* `a = 10` means *set a to 10*
//
* `a == 10` means *test if a is equal to 10*

== Comparisons Against Variables

[role='janini']
....
// Let's try out ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=
int first = 10;
int second = 20;
System.out.println(first > first);
....

== More Complex Comparisons

[role='janini']
....
// Let's try out ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=
int first = 10;
int second = 20;
System.out.println(first + second == 30);
....

== Questions About Comparisons?

== Monday Preview

[role='janini']
....
// Comparisons enable decisions
int first = 10;
if (first > 20) {
  System.out.println("First is greater than 20");
} else {
  System.out.println("First is not greater than 20");
}
....
