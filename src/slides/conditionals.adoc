== Comparisons

[.lead]
//
Java also allows me to compare different variables: either against literal
values, or against other variables.

This is basis for _simple decision making_.

== Simple Comparisons

[role='janini']
....
// Let's try out ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=
int tester = 10;
// This is equality
System.out.println(tester == 10);
....

== A Common Mistake

[.lead]
//
* `a = 10` means *set a to 10*
//
* `a == 10` means *test if a is equal to 10*

== Comparisons Against Variables

[role='janini']
....
// Let's try out ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=
int first = 10;
int second = 20;
System.out.println(first > first);
....

== More Complex Comparisons

[role='janini']
....
// Let's try out ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=
int first = 10;
int second = 20;
System.out.println(first + second == 30);
....

== Questions About Comparisons?

== Monday Preview

[role='janini']
....
// Comparisons enable decisions
int first = 10;
if (first > 20) {
  System.out.println("First is greater than 20");
} else {
  System.out.println("First is not greater than 20");
}
....
