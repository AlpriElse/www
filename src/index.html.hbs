          CS 125 begins training you to think and act like a computer
          scientist.

          It provides a high-level overview of many important computer science
          concepts&mdash;from hardware to algorithms, concurrency to
          object-oriented programming.

          Developing programming proficiency is a goal of the course, but we
          also want students to appreciate the depth and breadth of the field.

          At the end of the class, you'll be well on your way to an exciting
          future in the most exciting field out there.
