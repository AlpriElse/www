== Overview

[.lead]
//
This course is an introduction to the concepts and craft of computer science.
//
It will teach you to both _think_ and _act_ like a computer scientist.
//
It will change how you approach problems and provide you with powerful tools
that you can use to change the world.

Computer science is both an applied and a conceptual discipline.
//
You _will_ learn how to program in this course.
//
Learning how to program effectively helps you bring your ideas to life.
//
It can be frustrating at first&mdash;computers are irritatingly literal
machines.
//
But programming is a skill, and like any other skill you will get better with
practice.
//
Computers are one of the most powerful tools that we have at our disposal to
solve almost any problem.
//
Learning how to get them to do your bidding is extremely empowering.
//
You will quickly come to understand the hackers lament.
//
Once you can program well, you can do anything&mdash;just not everything.

But while programming is both important and enjoyable, computer science also
has deep conceptual concerns at its core.
//
As a computer scientist, you'll learn to design solutions to problems so that
computers can carry them out efficiently&mdash;we call these algorithms.
//
Being a computer scientist means coming up with new ways to solve problems
more effectively.
//
And then you get to build your solutions and can easily deploy them to
billions of people all over the world.
//
**No other field has our potent mixture of left-brain analytics, right-brain
design and creativity, and the potential for global impact.**

=== Prerequisites

[.lead]
//
CS 125 has no prerequisites and assumes no prior knowledge of programming or
computer science.
//
However, the course is a lot of work---and so is best suited to those who are
either majoring in computer science or have a strong interest in the subject.

Some students in CS 125 have no experience with computer science.
//
Others have been programming for years.
//
We will do our best to accommodate both groups.

==== If you're new to computer science...

Welcome to the most exciting field on Earth!
//
We're extremely happy to have you.
//
We know that it can be hard to get started, but trust us&mdash;you'll get
better with practice.
//
Programming is a skill.
//
The more you do, the better you get.
//
If you're willing to put in the time and energy, we're here to help you
succeed.

When you're starting something new, it's normal to occasionally feel
intimidated by those around you.
//
We were all new once, and most of us try new things at least once and a while.
//
So we know what it feels like.
//
Just remember that no matter how it may seem, there are a lot of other
students in CS 125 that are beginners too.
//
And if you're working harder than some other students in the class, then it
just means that you're learning more than they are.

Also keep in mind that computer scientists can get extremely excited about
what they know.
//
Our field is awesome, and we're all learning new things all of the time.
//
Unfortunately, sometimes that can come off as arrogance or bragging.
//
But don't let it get you down.
//
We want you to share in the excitement, and will do our best to make sure that
happens.

==== If you think you already know what you are doing...

There's so much more to learn!
//
No matter how much background in computer science you have, there are always
new areas to explore, new languages to learn, new problems to solve.

Even if you don't find every aspect of CS 125 challenging, we hope that it can
continue to move you forward on your journey in computer science.
//
Keep in mind that continuing to develop as a programmer requires practice.
//
If the MPs don't take you that long, then you aren't getting the practice that
you need to keep improving.
//
You might want to join the http://cs196.xyz/[honors section (CS 196)],
//
get involved with the
//
https://acm.illinois.edu/[Illinois Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)],
//
or just make sure that you have some side projects to keep you busy.

And please feel free to help other students in the class that might not know
as much as you.
//
One of the best things about computer science is the community of generous and
patient people willing to help beginners get started.

== Communication

[.lead]
//
CS 125 is a large class.
//
This makes it important for us to communicate with each other in effective ways.

We have set up a comprehensive and well-organized course website
footnote:[You're using it!] and modern link:/forum/[course forum] to help you
find our what you need to know.
//
Our goal is to avoid email as much as possible, along with other 1-to-1 forms of
communication that don't scale well to large numbers of students.

=== Where to Find Information About CS 125

There are two primary sources of information for CS 125:

. This website
//
. The link:/forum/[course forum].

If you have a question about the class, first look on the main course
website&mdash;the one that you are currently browsing.
//
Then, search the link:/forum/[course forum]&mdash;maybe another student has
asked your question and we've already answered it.
//
If you still can't find an answer, post your question on the link:/forum/[course
forum].

=== What You Are Responsible For

As a student at the University of Illinois **you are responsible for email sent
to your `@illinois.edu` email address.**
//
We will occasionally use a course email list to send important announcements.
//
So messages in your inbox might say things like: "There's a quiz tomorrow" or
"There's a fire alarm in Siebel and class is cancelled."
//
We all get too much email, but learning to manage it is a fact of modern life.
//
Feel free to talk to the course staff if you want tips.

As a student in CS 125 **you are responsible for messages posted in the
announcements category of the link:/forum/[course forum].**
//
These announcements are important and we will frequently post in this category
in lieu of using email.
//
You can configure Discourse to send emails each time a topic is created in a
specific category.
//
We would suggest that you do that&mdash;or plan on visiting the forum each and
every day.
//
In fact, both are good ideas.

=== How to Contact the Course Staff

[.lead]
//
**Please do not email the course staff with general course questions.**
//
You should also never contact a TA or doyen directly unless they have agreed to
this beforehand.
//
_Post on link:/forum/[the forum]_.

This is not because we don't like you or don't like email.
//
It's simply because there are a lot of you, a much smaller number of us, and
many of the questions that you have are shared by other students.
//
If you email us, we can answer your question to one person: you.
//
If you post on the forum, we can answer your question to the entire class.
//
And you may find that your question has already been answered, or that another
student can answer it for you.

Here is a general guide about how to contact the course staff:

* [.underline]#I need help installing (insert name of software here)...:# post
on link:/forum/[the forum].
//
* [.underline]#I'm confused about (insert name of concept here)...:# post
on link:/forum/[the forum].
//
* [.underline]#I need help with (insert any CS 125-related item here)...:# post
on link:/forum/[the forum].
//
* [.underline]#I can't find (insert name of CS 125-related resource here)...:#
post on link:/forum/[the forum].

Can you see a pattern emerging here?

In contrast, here are some cases where you _can_ and _should_ contact the course
instructors:

* **I think that my friend is cheating in CS 125**: contact the course staff.
//
* **I'm really sick and getting behind in the class**: contact the course staff.
//
* **I'm feeling really overwhelmed and need someone to talk to**: contact the
course staff, or an academi advisor, or a friend.
