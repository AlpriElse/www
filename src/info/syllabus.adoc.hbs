This web page serves as the syllabus for the course.

You should familiarize yourself with these policies and refer to them when
necessary.

== Overview

[.lead]
//
This course is an introduction to the concepts and craft of computer science.
//
It will teach you to both _think_ and _act_ like a computer scientist.
//
It will change how you approach problems and provide you with powerful tools
that you can use to change the world.

Computer science is both an applied and a conceptual discipline.
//
You _will_ learn how to program in this course.
//
Learning how to program effectively helps you bring your ideas to life.
//
It can be frustrating at first&mdash;computers are irritatingly literal
machines.
//
But programming is a skill, and like any other skill you will get better with
practice.
//
Computers are one of the most powerful tools that we have at our disposal to
solve almost any problem.
//
Learning how to get them to do your bidding is extremely empowering.
//
You will quickly come to understand the hackers lament.
//
Once you can program well, you can do anything&mdash;just not everything.

But while programming is both important and enjoyable, computer science also
has deep conceptual concerns at its core.
//
As a computer scientist, you'll learn to design solutions to problems so that
computers can carry them out efficiently&mdash;we call these algorithms.
//
Being a computer scientist means coming up with new ways to solve problems
more effectively.
//
And then you get to build your solutions and can easily deploy them to
billions of people all over the world.
//
**No other field has our potent mixture of left-brain analytics, right-brain
design and creativity, and the potential for global impact.**

=== Prerequisites

[.lead]
//
CS 125 has no prerequisites and assumes no prior knowledge of programming or
computer science.
//
However, the course is a lot of work---and so is best suited to those who are
either majoring in computer science or have a strong interest in the subject.

Some students in CS 125 have no experience with computer science.
//
Others have been programming for years.
//
We will do our best to accommodate both groups.

==== If you're new to computer science...

Welcome to the most exciting field on Earth!
//
We're extremely happy to have you.
//
We know that it can be hard to get started, but trust us&mdash;you'll get
better with practice.
//
Programming is a skill.
//
The more you do, the better you get.
//
If you're willing to put in the time and energy, we're here to help you
succeed.

When you're starting something new, it's normal to occasionally feel
intimidated by those around you.
//
We were all new once, and most of us try new things at least once and a while.
//
So we know what it feels like.
//
Just remember that no matter how it may seem, there are a lot of other
students in CS 125 that are beginners too.
//
And if you're working harder than some other students in the class, then it
just means that you're learning more than they are.

Also keep in mind that computer scientists can get extremely excited about
what they know.
//
Our field is awesome, and we're all learning new things all of the time.
//
Unfortunately, sometimes that can come off as arrogance or bragging.
//
But don't let it get you down.
//
We want you to share in the excitement, and will do our best to make sure that
happens.

==== If you think you already know what you are doing...

There's so much more to learn!
//
No matter how much background in computer science you have, there are always
new areas to explore, new languages to learn, new problems to solve.

Even if you don't find every aspect of CS 125 challenging, we hope that it can
continue to move you forward on your journey in computer science.
//
Keep in mind that continuing to develop as a programmer requires practice.
//
If the MPs don't take you that long, then you aren't getting the practice that
you need to keep improving.
//
You might want to join the http://cs196.xyz/[honors section (CS 196)],
//
get involved with the
//
https://acm.illinois.edu/[Illinois Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)],
//
or just make sure that you have some side projects to keep you busy.

And please feel free to help other students in the class that might not know
as much as you.
//
One of the best things about computer science is the community of generous and
patient people willing to help beginners get started.

// == Course Policies

== Communication

[.lead]
//
CS 125 is a large class.
//
This makes it important for us to communicate with each other in effective ways.

We have set up a comprehensive and well-organized course website
footnote:[You're using it!] and modern link:/forum/[course forum] to help you
find our what you need to know.
//
Our goal is to avoid email as much as possible, along with other 1-to-1 forms of
communication that don't scale well to large numbers of students.

=== Where to Find Information About CS 125

There are two primary sources of information for CS 125:

. This website
//
. The link:/forum/[course forum].

If you have a question about the class, first look on the main course
website&mdash;the one that you are currently browsing.
//
Then, search the link:/forum/[course forum]&mdash;maybe another student has
asked your question and we've already answered it.
//
If you still can't find an answer, post your question on the link:/forum/[course
forum].

=== What You Are Responsible For

As a student at the University of Illinois **you are responsible for email sent
to your `@illinois.edu` email address.**
//
We will occasionally use a course email list to send important announcements.
//
So messages in your inbox might say things like: "There's a quiz tomorrow" or
"There's a fire alarm in Siebel and class is canceled."
//
We all get too much email, but learning to manage it is a fact of modern life.
//
Feel free to talk to the course staff if you want tips.

As a student in CS 125 **you are responsible for messages posted in the
announcements category of the link:/forum/[course forum].**
//
These announcements are important and we will frequently post in this category
in lieu of using email.
//
You can configure Discourse to send emails each time a topic is created in a
specific category.
//
We would suggest that you do that&mdash;or plan on visiting the forum each and
every day.
//
In fact, both are good ideas.

[[contacting]]
=== How to Contact the Course Staff

[.lead]
//
**Please do not email the course staff with general course questions.**
//
You should also never contact a TA or doyen directly unless they have agreed to
this beforehand.
//
_Post on link:/forum/[the forum]_.

This is not because we don't like you or don't like email.
//
It's simply because there are a lot of you, a much smaller number of us, and
many of the questions that you have are shared by other students.
//
If you email us, we can answer your question to one person: you.
//
If you post on the forum, we can answer your question to the entire class.
//
And you may find that your question has already been answered, or that another
student can answer it for you.

Here is a general guide about how to contact the course staff:

* [.underline]#I need help installing (insert name of software here)...:# post
on link:/forum/[the forum].
//
* [.underline]#I'm confused about (insert name of concept here)...:# post
on link:/forum/[the forum].
//
* [.underline]#I need help with (insert any CS 125-related item here)...:# post
on link:/forum/[the forum].
//
* [.underline]#I can't find (insert name of CS 125-related resource here)...:#
post on link:/forum/[the forum].

Can you see a pattern emerging here?

In contrast, here are some cases where you _can_ and _should_ contact the course
instructors:

* **I think that my friend is cheating in CS 125**: contact the course staff.
//
* **I'm really sick and getting behind in the class**: contact the course staff.
//
* **I'm feeling really overwhelmed and need someone to talk to**: contact the
course staff, or an academic advisor, or a friend.

[[mps]]
== Machine Problems (MPs)

[.lead]
//
Programming is a skill.
//
Like other skills, the more you do it, the better at it you become.
//
The CS 125 _machine problems_ (MPs)
//
footnote:[Known in other places as _programming assignments_]
//
are the primary way that you will learn the powerful skill of computer
programming&mdash;today's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc&t=81s[modern superpower].

Together the MPs are worth only 15% of your grade.
//
But working on them will deepen your understand of the material covered in
lecture, and improve your performance on the quizzes and final exam.

=== How to Complete the MPs

The CS 125 MPs are designed to take a significant amount of time.
//
So you should arrange your schedule so that you can devote a significant amount
of time on them.
//
**Do not start the night before.**
//
Not only will it be unlikely that you will complete the MP, but you will also be
unlikely to be able to get help when you get stuck.

Learning to program is like learning other skills&mdash;how to play an
instrument, throw a perfect spiral, cook the perfect omelete, or learn another
_human_ language.
//
You have to do it _every day_.
//
You can't expect to complete a marathon or perform at Carnegie Hall if you start
practicing the night before.
//
As soon as each MP is released, sit down and spend a few hours on it.
//
And then do that the next day, and the day after that.
//
If you start early and work often, you will have no problem completing the MP
before the deadline.
//
If it turns out to be easy for you, you'll be done early and can relax and help
other students.
//
If it turns out to be more difficult, you'll know early on and be able to budget
your time according to complete it on time.
//
**Nothing correlates more strongly with success on the MPs than starting
early.**

[[regrading]]
=== MP Regrade Policy

This semester we will use two different MP regrading policies&mdash;one for MPs
1&ndash;3, the second for MPs 4 and onward.

==== MP1&ndash;MP3

* You can commit MP1&ndash;MP3 as many times as you want until Friday, December
8th, 2017.
//
* You will lose 1 percentage point (usually out of 100) for each week that your
submission is late relative to the original deadline.
//
So if the deadline was Friday at 5PM and you commit on that same Friday at 6PM,
you lose 1 point.
//
If you submit the _next_ Friday at 6PM, you lose two points.
//
* Late submissions will not recover any starting the assignment on time points.
//
* **You will always receive the best score earned by any submission.**

==== MP4 onward

* You can commit MP4 and later MPs as many times as you want until Friday,
December 8th, 2017.
//
* Late submissions can earn back 50% of any points lost by your best on-time
submission.
//
So if you submit code that earns 80/100 before the deadline, you will receive a
90/100 if you submit a perfect MP after the deadline.
//
If you submit code that earns 0/100 before the deadline, the best you can do is
a 50/100 with a perfect submission anytime after the deadline.
//
* Late submissions will not recover any starting the assignment on time points.
//
So if there were 10 starting the assignment on time points that you did not
earn, and your best score before the deadline was a 60/100, the best you can do
is a 85/100: half of the 30 points you missed that were not for starting the
assignment on time.
//
* **You will always receive the best score earned by any submission.**

[[quizzes]]
== Quizzes

[.lead]
//
Weekly quizzes are the largest component of your CS 125 grade.
//
Most are given in the https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/[University of Illinois
Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF)].
//
Some may also be given during your lab section.

CBTF quizzes consist of questions that are automatically generated and graded.
//
No course staff members are involved in grading _almost all_ CS 125 quizzes, so
please do not appeal your grade to the course staff.
//
If you have concerns about the questions themselves, please post on the forum.

=== Scheduling

The CBTF is located in the basement of https://goo.gl/M8C8vN[Grainger Library].
//
You can use https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/[this link] to sign up to take each
quiz.
//
Using the CBTF allows us to provide you with flexibility in scheduling your
weekly quizzes.
//
You can take each quiz over a range of dates and times, usually Friday through
Tuesday.

=== Preparation

Quizzes focus on material covered that week, but all material covered that
semester is fair game.
//
**The best way to prepare for a quiz is to participate in class that week.**
//
Attend lectures and participate, attend labs and participate, work on the
assigned MP (if any), and ask and answer questions on the link:/forum/[course
forum].
//
If you engage with the course content on a daily basis, you will not need to
cram material right before you take the quiz.

=== Missed Quizzes

Because you have a several day window to complete each quiz, we expect that you
will be able to work around most other commitments and even short illnesses.
//
As a result, if you miss a quiz you will be subject to the following penalties:

* **1st missed quiz**: you will receive 80% of the average on
the rest of your quizzes
//
* **2nd missed quiz**: you will receive 70% of the average on
the rest of your quizzes
//
* **3rd missed quiz**: you will receive 50% of the average on
the rest of your quizzes

== Grading

[.lead]
//
Your grade in CS 125 is determined by your performance on weekly _quizzes_,
your completion of the course _machine problems_ (MPs), a written _final exam_,
completion of _Turing's Craft exercises_, and lecture and lab _participation
points_.

=== Grade Components

Your total score in CS 125 is broken down as follows:

[.table.table-striped,options='header',cols='2']
|===

^| Component
^| Percentage (%)

| Weekly Quizzes
^| 45%

| Final Exam

=== Estimating Your Letter Grade

Letter grades in CS 125 are assigned based on how well _you_ do, not based on
your performance relative to other students.
//
**We have an unlimited number of A grades that we can hand out.**
//
If everyone in the learns all of the material to our
satisfaction, everyone in the class will make an A.

Inevitably the difficulty of various parts of the course varies from semester to
semester.
//
So we do not determine the final grading scale until we examine all scores at
the end of the semester.
//
During the semester, do not ask us to estimate your grade or tell you how well
you need to do on an assignment to make a certain grade.
//
The fact that the final exam is worth 25% of your grade also makes it pointless
to try to project your final grade midway through the course.

**Instead, focus on learning the material to the best of your ability.**
//
Programming in particular is a skill&mdash;the more you do, the better you get
at it.
//
So you should focus on doing as much as you need to get good at it, rather than
the minimum necessary to make a particular grade.

However, the following table can be used to provide you with a _rough
approximation_ of the letter grade that you will receive:

[.table.table-striped,options='header',cols='2*^']
|===

>| If you earn at least...#
<| you will probably get at least an...

| 65%
| C-

| 80%
| B-

| 90%
| A-

|===

=== Posting Letter Grades

We do not continuously maintain course grades on
https://compass2g.illinois.edu/webapps/login/[Compass].
//
We will post final letter grades there at the end of the term.
